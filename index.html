          Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a <span class="noun1"></span>; but she would have to be a real princess. He <span class="verb1"></span> all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were <span class="animal1"></span> enough, but it was <span class="adjective"></span> to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real <span class="noun2"></span>.</p>

          <p>One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and <span class="verb1"></span>, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a <span class="verb2"></span> was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.</p>

          <p>It was a <span class="noun2"></span> standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real <span class="animal1"></span>.</p>

          <p>Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a <span class="animal1"></span> on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the <span class="animal1"></span>, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.</p>

          <p>On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.</p>

          <p>"Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have <span class="adjective"></span> closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was <span class="adjective"></span> on <span class="noun2"></span> hard, so that I am <span class="adjective"></span> all over my body. It's <span class="noun1"></span>!"</p>

         <p>Now they knew that she was a real <span class="noun1"></span> because she had felt the <span class="noun2"></span> right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.</p>
